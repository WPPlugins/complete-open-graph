Simple, comprehensive, customizable Open Graph management.

== Description ==

There's no shortage of plugins that promise to be THE all-in-one solution for all things SEO. Unfortunately, this often means lack of flexibility, confusing implementation, or just a big, bloated plugin that carries way too many features for your use case.

This plugin is built on an alternative philosophy: do one thing and one thing well. Complete Open Graph provides automatic, comprehensive, just-makes-sense Open Graph management, whether it's for a simple blog or a complex site with diverse sets of data.

Out of the box, Complete Open Graph generates all the basic tags your site should have, making it ready for effective social sharing on platforms including Twitter, Facebook and Google+, and gives you full programmatic access to filter this data as you need.

TL;DR: This plugin does Open Graph. Freaking good Open Graph.

== Installation ==

1. Download the plugin and upload to your plugins directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins page.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' page.
3. (Optional) Use the Settings->Open Graph screen to set your default Open Graph data.

== Using the Plugin ==

Upon activation, Complete Open Graph is ready to generate Open Graph meta tags, with a mature set of fallbacks in place. Literally no configuration is required to begin making your site socially shareable. 

= Available Fields =

On each page and post, the following fields are automatically generated, based on available page data. Many of these can be manually set at the page level.

* og:site_name
* og:locale
* og:type
* og:title
* og:url
* og:description
* og:image
* og:image:width
* og:image:height
* twitter:card
* twitter:creator
* twitter:title
* twitter:description
* twitter:image
* twitter:url
* twitter:card
* twitter:site

= Default Settings =

As a fallback for values that aren't filled automatically by a page or post, you can set default values for Open Graph data. If desired, you can force these individual values to be used globally, overriding whatever is set at a page level. 

* og:type
* og:title
* og:image
* og:description
* twitter:description
* twitter:creator
* twitter:site
* fb:admins
* fb:app_id

== Filters ==

= Filtering Open Graph Data = 

The `complete_open_graph_all_data` filter allows the customization of the entire set of Open Graph values, as well as the addition of new meta tags (including those that aren't Open Graph).

Example for customizing out-of-the-box Open Graph data:
`
function modify_open_graph_data($data) {
  $data['site_name']['value'] = 'whatevs';
  return $data;
}
add_filter('complete_open_graph_data', 'modify_open_graph_data');
`

Example for adding a standard, old meta tag:
`
function add_new_open_graph_fields($data) {
    $data['keywords']['attribute'] = 'name';
    $data['keywords']['value'] = 'keyword1,keyword2,keyword3';
    return $data;
}
add_filter('complete_open_graph_data', 'add_new_open_graph_fields');
`

The `complete_open_graph_single_value` filter allows you to modify single Open Graph field values. This filter only applies to fields that are generated by looping through a progression of priorities:

* description
* title
* type
* image
* twitter:title
* twitter:image
* twitter:description
* twitter:creator

Example for manipulating a single value:
`
function manipulate_single_value($value, $field_name) {
    if($field_name === 'description') {
        return 'WHATEVER I WANT.';
    }
    return $value;
}
add_filter('complete_open_graph_single_value', 'manipulate_single_value', 10, 2);
`

== Order of Priority ==

There's a fallback system set in place for you to effectively leverage this plugin.

1. *Filters* - Any filters you apply will take priority over any fields you have filled in the admin.
2. *Forced Global Settings* - If you've checked the box on these fields on the settings page, they'll override everything non-filtered. 
2. *Post/Page Fields* - Filling out the metabox fields on a page or post in the WordPress Admin will give it priority over any global settings.
3. *Default Settings* - These will take priority over any core WordPress settings in place (site name, description).
4. *Blog Info* - When nothing else is overriding them, Open Graph fields will default to your general WordPress site settings.

After flowing through this order of priority, if there is still no content to be pulled, those respective Open Graph tags will not be generated. So, don't worry about having extra, useless tags just sitting there in your markup.

== Screenshots ==

1. Shows the global settings page, where you can define global values for Open Graph tags, which serve as a fallback in case these values are not occupied on individual posts or pages.
2. Shows the form available to customize Open Graph information on individual posts and pages.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= For which social sites will this plugin make my content shareable? =
Your content will be shareable to any site that processes Open Graph meta tags, including Facebook, Twitter, Google+, and LinkedIn. 

= Is any configuration needed out-of-the-box? = 
No. You may customize any data you want, but once you activate the plugin, it'll immediately begin pulling data from your existing site content.

= Should I use this in conjunction with other SEO/Open Graph plugins? = 
No, it's not recommended. COG does one thing and one thing well: Open Graph. If you're using another plugin to generate that markup, you'll end up with duplicate OG tags, which may throw flags in Facebook's debugger. 

= How do I make sure it's actually working? = 
Your best option is to use Facebook's Sharing Debugger found here: https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/. Another option is to share your page to Facebook, Twitter, and see what's rendered.
